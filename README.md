[Course link](https://learn.unrealengine.com/course/3061301)

Using Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) UI Designer, you will create some basic graphical interfaces for the user. You will be shown how the UMG system works and is integrated with Unreal Engine. This will enable you to create a visual system for the user to track relevant game-world changes and interact with the project through menus.
